### Changed

- Simplified the consensus presentation from six technical summary boxes to three user-facing concepts: Signal Strength, Confidence and Signal Alignment.
- Moved agreement, conflict, coverage, reliability and evidence-group internals behind `How was this calculated?`.

- Recommendation card is now explicitly strategy-labeled.
- Strategy Summary is the master selector for detailed analysis.
